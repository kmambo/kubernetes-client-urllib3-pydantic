# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V1CertificateSigningRequestCondition from a JSON string
v1_certificate_signing_request_condition_instance = V1CertificateSigningRequestCondition.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(V1CertificateSigningRequestCondition.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
v1_certificate_signing_request_condition_dict = v1_certificate_signing_request_condition_instance.to_dict()
