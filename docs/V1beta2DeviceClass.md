# V1beta2DeviceClass

DeviceClass is a vendor- or admin-provided resource that contains device configuration and selectors. It can be referenced in the device requests of a claim to apply these presets. Cluster scoped.  This is an alpha type and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**api_version** | **str** | APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources | [optional] 
**kind** | **str** | Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds | [optional] 
**metadata** | [**V1ObjectMeta**](V1ObjectMeta.md) | Standard object metadata | [optional] 
**spec** | [**V1beta2DeviceClassSpec**](V1beta2DeviceClassSpec.md) | Spec defines what can be allocated and how to configure it.  This is mutable. Consumers have to be prepared for classes changing at any time, either because they get updated or replaced. Claim allocations are done once based on whatever was set in classes at the time of allocation.  Changing the spec automatically increments the metadata.generation number. | 

## Example

```python
from kubernetes.models.v1beta2_device_class import V1beta2DeviceClass

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V1beta2DeviceClass from a JSON string
v1beta2_device_class_instance = V1beta2DeviceClass.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(V1beta2DeviceClass.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
v1beta2_device_class_dict = v1beta2_device_class_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of V1beta2DeviceClass from a dict
v1beta2_device_class_from_dict = V1beta2DeviceClass.from_dict(v1beta2_device_class_dict)
